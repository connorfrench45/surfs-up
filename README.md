# Surfs Up!
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to see if the surf and ice cream shop has year-round potential (based on weather analysis)
## Results
#### Benchmarks
What temperatures would make a surf and ice cream shop viable? Because this is a limited scope analysis, there are some judgment calls, but if it's determined that the shop is viable for June in Oahu, then it's important to compare June weather with December Weather.
#### June Temps
The analysis covered every recorded June temperature measurement from 2010 to 2017. This is th resulting analysis:

With 1700 data points, this gives a solid benchmark. Average temperature is 75 degrees, with very little variance. Not even the max and min temps are all that extreme. 
#### December Temps
Here is the December Temperatures analysis:

It's a little cooler in December (71 degrees to June's 75 degrees), but not significantly. The standard deviation is also a little bigger (3.7 to June's 3.2) but the mid 50% temperature range is similar (5 degree difference to June's 4 degree difference). This points to more extreme temperatures in December, which is backed by the difference in the mid and max temperature. 
## Summary
A surf and ice cream shop is plenty viable year round! December and June have similar average temperatures and both are well within ice cream eating range. The two biggest differences between June and December is that December is a little colder (71 vs. 75) and experiences more extreme temperatures. 
A temperature only analysis is extremely limited, however. I would strongly recommend doing a similar analysis for precipitation (since that is included in the data), as well as finding cloudiness or windiness for different times of the year.
